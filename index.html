            <p>Hello, my name is Monika! Originally from Bulgaria, but have been a Charlotte girl for the last 3 years. I was
                raised in a family of artists, so I decided to follow my parents steps and graduated Graphic Design in 2009.
                Right after, I felt that I need some extra challenge and went to law school. That was a fun ride! Moved to
                US in 2012 and have been stay-at-home mom for the last 3 years.
            </p>
            <p id="next">
                I like to cook, I love being outdoors and driving long distance. Any kind of art truly excites me, and so does problem-solving.
                Coding combines both worlds for me makes me totally in love with writing code! Full stack developer in progress.
            </p>
